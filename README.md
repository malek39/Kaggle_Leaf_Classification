# Kaggle_Leaf_Classification

## Overview
The objective of this playground competition is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. Leaves, due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of differentiating plant species. They also provide a fun introduction to applying techniques that involve image-based features.

As a first step, try building a classifier that uses the provided pre-extracted features. Next, try creating a set of your own features. Finally, examine the errors you're making and see what you can do to improve.

## Data Description
The dataset consists approximately 1,584 images of leaf specimens (16 samples each of 99 species) which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a Ô¨Åne-scale margin histogram. For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.

Note that of the original 100 species, we have eliminated one on account of incomplete associated data in the original dataset.
